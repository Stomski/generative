/*
So this is an exciting project for me, I have always marveled at these shapes and to direct my computer towards creating them is an exciting step.

these classes will define the boid object,

the accelerations and vectors for the objects,

and the interactions between them,
ie all the operations required in the relationing of the boids

export class Boid {
  //constructor
  constructor() {
    this.position = 2;
  }

  //boids haveeeee velocity, acceleration, position
  //
}
