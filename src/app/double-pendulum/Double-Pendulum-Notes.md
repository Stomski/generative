# DOUBLE PENDULUM!!!!

---

### the project:

build a small physics library in TS that allows me to build a simple pendulum, and then a double pendulum.

### The "Library"

so this is an exercise in TS, to build a class (thing?) that has:

1. position
2. velocity
3. acceleration
4. mass

### Typescript class declaration adventure begins!!!!!

these classes are going to be defined in their own file, app/physics-class/physics.ts
